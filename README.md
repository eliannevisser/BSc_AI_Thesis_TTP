# BPAI - Valid Initial Schedule Generation for TTP
This repository contains code for my thesis on valid initial schedule generation for the Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP).
The thesis is written as part of the BSc Artificial Intelligence programme at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, supervised by Daan Van Den Berg.

## Code
- ```schedule_creation.py``` contains the schedule generation process, the violation checker, and the experiment for the replication study.
- ```mutations.py``` contains the mutation types used in the algorithms.
- ``` hill_climbing.py```, ``` simulated_annealing.py``` and ``` plant_propagation.py``` contain the implementations of the algorithms.

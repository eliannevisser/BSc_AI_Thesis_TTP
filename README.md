# BPAI - Valid Initial Schedule Generation for TTP
This is the repository containing code for my thesis on valid initial schedule generation for the Traveling Tournament Problem (TTP).
The thesis was written as part of the BSc Artificial Intelligence programme at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, supervised by Daan Van Den Berg.

## Code
- ```schedule_creation.py``` contains the schedule generation process, as well as the violation checker and and experiment for the replication study.
- ```mutations.py``` contains the mutation types used for in the algorithms.
- ``` hill_climbing.py```, ``` simulated_annealing.py``` and ``` plant_propagation.py``` contain the implementations of the algorithms.
